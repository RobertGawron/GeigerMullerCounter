GeigerMullerCounter
====

The Geiger–Müller counter is a relatively simple tool to measure ionizing radiation. When high voltage (typically 380-420V) is applied to the Geiger–Müller tube, the tube doesn't conducts electricity, but it does conducts for a short period, when radiation particle is observed. Those pulses are observed by the detector. The level of ionizing radiation is proportional to the amount of pulses detected in a constant interval of time (typically from 20s to 2,5min).

## Hazards

* **The device uses high voltage and can lead to unpleasant shock, injury or death. Don't touch the PCB or tubes when power is on.**
