## Introduction

For more details about the hardware design and implementation, visit my [blog post on the Geiger–Müller counter](http://robertgawron.blogspot.com/2015/02/homemade-geigermuller-counter-part-i.html).

# Remarks

Depending on the coil you used, you may need to adjust R3, R4, and R5. If the voltage is too low, try decreasing R4 first.
